# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game  project, developed as part of the Frontend Development task for She Code Africa's Pair Learning Program.

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, enhanced with game statistics such as the number of games played and the number of wins for each player. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Game Interface**: The game interface provides a grid layout for the Tic-Tac-Toe board using HTML's `<table>` element.
- **Game Statistics**: Players can view game statistics, including the number of games played and the number of wins for each player.
- **Player Turn Indicator**: The current player's turn is indicated dynamically in the UI.
- **Win Detection**: The game logic includes win detection to determine when a player has won the game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on any empty cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe grid to place your mark (X or O).
3. The game will automatically detect when a player has won or when the game ends in a draw.
4. View the game statistics to track the number of games played and wins for each player.
